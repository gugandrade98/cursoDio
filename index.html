          text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been
          the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an
          unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
          specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
          leap into electronic

            >typesetting</a
          >, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
          with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
          and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
